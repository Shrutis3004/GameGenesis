        Assassin's Creed is a historical action-adventure video game series and
        media franchise published by Ubisoft and developed mainly by its studio
        Ubisoft Montreal using the game engine Anvil and its more advanced
        derivatives. Created by Patrice DÃ©silets, Jade Raymond, and Corey May,
        the Assassin's Creed video game series depicts a fictional millennia-old
        struggle between the Order of Assassins, who fight for peace and free
        will, and the Knights Templar, who desire peace through order and
        control. The series features historical fiction, science fiction, and
        fictional characters intertwined with real-world historical events and
        historical figures.
